#Arthmatic operators in python are =,+=,_=,*=,/=,%=,**=,//=,&=,|=,<<=,>>=,:=
#let's see all these operators with a variable
x=3
x+=2

x*=2#now x=3
print("Same as Multiplication with 2 = ",x)
x/=2#now x=6
print("Same as Division with 2 = ",x)
x%=2#now x=3
x=4
print("Same as Modulus  with 2 = ",x)
x**=2#now x assigned to value of 4
print("Same as Exponent with 2 = ",x)
x//=2#now x=8
print("Same as Floor division with 2 = ",x)
x&=2#now x=8

x=8
x^=2#now x=8
print("Same as Bitwise XOR with 2 = ",x)
